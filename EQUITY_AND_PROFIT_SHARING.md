# Guardian Override Equity and Profit Sharing v1.0_draft

This document explains how equity and profit sharing work within Guardian Override. It is designed to be clear, fair, and transparent so that contributors understand how value is created and shared.

---

## Guiding principles

- **Transparency:** All agreements are written in plain language and shared openly.
- **Fairness:** Rewards reflect actual contributions and responsibilities.
- **Accountability:** Commitments are honored, and changes are documented.
- **Dignity:** No contributor is treated as disposable; participation is respected.
- **Sustainability:** Structures are designed to support long-term growth and community trust.

---

## Equity

Equity represents ownership in Guardian Override. It is granted to contributors who take on significant, ongoing responsibility.

- **Founders:** Founders hold initial equity based on their role in creating the project.
- **Core contributors:** Equity may be offered to contributors who consistently provide major technical, design, or governance work.
- **Vesting:** Equity is typically subject to vesting (e.g., over 4 years with a 1-year cliff) to ensure commitment and alignment.
- **Documentation:** All equity agreements are recorded in writing and signed by both parties.

## Profit sharing

Profit sharing allows contributors who do not hold equity to still benefit from the success of Guardian Override.

- **Eligibility:** Contributors who provide meaningful work (code, design, documentation, governance, outreach) may be included in profit-sharing pools.
- **Distribution:** Profits are shared based on agreed percentages or contribution points, reviewed regularly.
- **Timing:** Profit distributions occur after covering operating costs and reserves for sustainability.
- **Transparency:** Reports of profit-sharing allocations are shared with all participants.

## Contribution categories

Contributions may be recognized in different ways:

- **Technical:** Code, architecture, testing, and infrastructure.
- **Design:** User experience, onboarding, accessibility, and documentation.
- **Governance:** Community standards, onboarding guides, and conflict resolution.
- **Outreach:** Partnerships, communication, and community building.

Each category can earn either equity (for long-term roles) or profit-sharing (for shorter-term or project-based contributions).

---

## Decision-making

- **Founders and maintainers** decide when equity or profit-sharing is offered.
- **Criteria:** Decisions are based on impact, consistency, and alignment with Guardian Override’s mission.
- **Review:** Agreements are revisited periodically to ensure fairness and sustainability.

---

## Example structures

- **Equity:** A core contributor joins early, commits to ongoing development, and receives 1% equity vesting over 4 years.
- **Profit sharing:** A designer contributes onboarding flows for 3 months and receives a share of profits from that release cycle.

---

## Rights and responsibilities

- **Equity holders:** Have voting rights in major decisions and share in long-term value.
- **Profit-sharing participants:** Receive financial rewards but do not hold ownership or voting rights.
- **All contributors:** Agree to follow the [Community Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and uphold Guardian Override’s values.

---

## Updates

This document is a living agreement. As Guardian Override grows, equity and profit-sharing structures may evolve. Updates will be made openly and with input from contributors.
