Community code of conduct

This Code of Conduct defines shared expectations for behavior to keep our community welcoming, safe, and constructive for everyone. It applies across all spaces where the project is present: repositories, issues, discussions, pull requests, documentation, community channels, events, and any direct communications related to project work.

We commit to building a culture of empathy, respect, and accountability.

Responsibilities and scope

- Maintainers’ role: Maintainers are responsible for clarifying standards, setting the tone, and taking fair, consistent corrective action when inappropriate behavior occurs.
- Scope of application: This Code applies to all project spaces and when an individual is representing the project publicly, including at online or in-person events, social channels, and third-party platforms used by the community.
- Community accountability: By participating, you agree to abide by this Code and to accept guidance from moderators and maintainers.

Reporting and support

- Where to report: Report concerns privately to the maintainers via the designated channel (e.g., conduct@project.org or a confidential form). If unsure, contact any maintainer to be directed appropriately.
- Confidentiality: Reports will be handled promptly and confidentially. We will not publicly name reporters without explicit consent.
- Information to include: Provide a description of the incident, where it occurred, names or handles of individuals involved, any witnesses, and any relevant links or screenshots.
- Immediate safety: If anyone is in immediate danger, contact local emergency services before notifying maintainers.

Enforcement guidelines

When a report is received, maintainers will follow these guidelines to determine consequences proportionate to the behavior and impact.

1. Correction
   - Community impact: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome but with limited impact.
   - Consequence: A private, written warning and clarification of expectations.

2. Warning
   - Community impact: A single incident or pattern of behavior that negatively affects participants or disrupts collaboration.
   - Consequence: A formal warning with clear expectations and consequences, potentially including moderation of interactions.

3. Temporary suspension
   - Community impact: Continued inappropriate behavior after warnings or serious violations.
   - Consequence: Temporary restriction from participation (e.g., commenting, committing, joining meetings) for a defined period.

4. Permanent suspension
   - Community impact: Demonstrated pattern of harmful behavior, harassment, or actions undermining community safety and trust.
   - Consequence: Permanent ban from project spaces and activities.

- Appeals: Individuals may appeal decisions by submitting a concise, factual statement. Maintainers will review appeals with an additional moderator for impartiality.
- Consistency: Similar incidents should receive similar consequences. Maintainers will document enforcement decisions to ensure consistency over time.

Community expectations for maintainers

- Transparency: Document decisions affecting community safety (without disclosing private details) and publish aggregate summaries where feasible.
- Impartiality: Recuse from handling reports where there is a conflict of interest; involve neutral moderators when needed.
- Restorative approach: When appropriate, focus on learning and repair alongside consequences.
- Periodic review: Revisit this Code regularly to address gaps, evolving needs, and community feedback.

Attribution and adoption

This Code of Conduct draws inspiration from widely adopted open-source community practices and templates that emphasize proactive, enforceable standards and clear reporting procedures. Adopting and enforcing a code of conduct signals an inclusive environment and equips maintainers to address problems effectively.
