# guardian-override
**Tagline:** Guardian-first emotional redirect and clause-simulation toolkit (prototype).
## Summary
This repository contains the scaffold for a hypothetical family-focused "guardian" system that helps preview and apply short, trauma-informed redirect clauses across web platforms and devices. This scaffold includes documentation, mock schemas, a Chrome extension scaffold, Android app skeleton, simulator engine stubs, and placeholder assets.

## Modules
- docs: public-facing spec and ethics docs
- extension: Chrome extension mock
- android: Android app skeleton
- simulator: clause preview engine
- clauses, schemas, ai-models: data and model spec stubs
- packages: SDK and CLI skeletons
- tests: surface-level tests and mocks

## Build logic
This is a scaffold. No build scripts included; intended to be a starting point for a multi-platform prototype.
