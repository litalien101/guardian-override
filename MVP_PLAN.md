# Guardian Override MVP Plan - v1.02_draft

This document outlines the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) plan for Guardian Override.  
The goal is to deliver a working prototype that demonstrates the core values of dignity, transparency, and emotional safety while setting healthy screen boundaries.

---

## Objectives

- Build a simple, testable prototype that shows how Guardian Override redirects attention gently.
- Provide clear documentation and onboarding so contributors and families understand the purpose.
- Validate core flows: rule creation, simulation, redirect, and logging.
- Keep everything transparent, respectful, and easy to understand.

---

## Core features

1. **Rule creation**
   - Define boundaries (e.g., time spent scrolling, number of redirects).
   - Use plain JSON schemas for clarity and consistency.

2. **Simulator**
   - Preview rules before applying them.
   - Show how redirects would work in different scenarios.

3. **Redirects**
   - Gentle nudges (e.g., “Time to stretch!”).
   - No punishment, no hidden monitoring.

4. **Logging and journaling**
   - Record every redirect.
   - Provide logs for family review and discussion.

---

## Platforms

- **Web/Extension:** Chrome extension prototype for real-time redirects.
- **Mobile:** Android skeleton app for testing mobile boundaries.
- **Simulator:** Node-based simulator for safe previews and testing.

---

## Deliverables

- **Docs:** Clear onboarding guide, code of conduct, governance, equity/profit sharing, and roadmap.
- **Schemas:** JSON structures for rules, triggers, and actions.
- **Prototype code:** Working simulator, extension scaffolding, and Android skeleton.
- **Logs:** Basic journaling system to capture redirect events.

---

## Timeline

- **Phase 1 (Weeks 1–4):**  
  Build simulator, draft schemas, and create onboarding docs.

- **Phase 2 (Weeks 5–8):**  
  Connect simulator to Chrome extension and Android skeleton.

- **Phase 3 (Weeks 9–12):**  
  Add logging/journaling and refine user flows.

- **Phase 4 (Weeks 13–16):**  
  Usability testing, accessibility improvements, and prepare for pilot release.

---

## Success criteria

- Families can set and preview rules without confusion.
- Redirects feel gentle and respectful.
- Logs are clear and useful for discussion.
- Documentation is easy to read and free of jargon.
- Contributors can onboard quickly and understand governance.

---

## Risks and mitigations

- **Risk:** Rules feel too restrictive.  
  **Mitigation:** Use simulator previews and family review to adjust.

- **Risk:** Documentation feels complex.  
  **Mitigation:** Keep language plain and provide examples.

- **Risk:** Technical scaffolding slows progress.  
  **Mitigation:** Focus on core flows first; treat other modules as placeholders.

---

## Next steps

- Finalize schemas for rules and actions.
- Strengthen simulator with test cases.
- Expand onboarding materials for contributors.
- Begin pilot testing with extension and Android skeleton.
